I m in my bedAnd you re not hereAnd there s no one to blamebut the drink and my wandering handsForget what I saidIt s not what I meantAnd I can t take it backI can t unpack the baggage you leftWhat am I now What am I nowWhat if I m someoneI don t want aroundI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin What if I m down What if I m outWhat if I m someoneyou won t talk aboutI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin You said you careand you missed me tooAnd I m well awareI write too many songs about youAnd the coffee s outat the Beachwood CafeAnd it kills me cause I knowwe ve ran out of things we can sayWhat am I now What am I nowWhat if I m someoneI don t want aroundI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin What if I m down What if I m outWhat if I m someoneyou won t talk aboutI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin And I get the feelingthat you ll never need me againWhat am I now What am I nowWhat if you re someoneI just want aroundI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin What if I m down What if I m outWhat if I m someoneyou won t talk aboutI m falling againI m falling again I m fallin
